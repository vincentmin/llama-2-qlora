This repository is designed to make it easy to train and evaluate llama-2 models. The default settings can be ran for free on Google Colab.
Follow the instructions in the `QLoRA_Llama2` notebook to train your own model.
Follow the instructions in the `Evaluation_harness` notebook to evaluate your model. By default we evaluate on the MMLU dataset.
The model that resulted from my own training run are available here: https://huggingface.co/vincentmin/llama-7b-orca/tree/main
